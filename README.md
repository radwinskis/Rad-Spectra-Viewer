# Rad-Spectra-Viewer
The Rad Spectra Viewer, a Python based application to interactively view visible-to-near-infrared spectra, is available in this repository as either 
1) a Python script to open via terminal, or 
2) a downloadable folder containing a Windows .exe

# Installation: 
Either download and run the python file "Spectra_Viewer_Application.py" or download and extract the following folder to your folder of choice:

# Functionality:
- Opens and reads .csv files with data in columns, and the wavelength values in the first column. NOTE: the script expects wavelength in nanometers.
- Plots spectra on a matplotlib figure
- Specify number of curves to display at a time
- Buttons to view next or previous spectrum (or set of spectra)
- Option to turn off/on grid-lines
- Options to change x and y-axis bounds
- Options to change multiple-interval for x-axis minor and major tick marks
- Option to place vertical reference line at custom wavelength value
- Toolbar with interactive pan, zoom, save figure options, and methods to change other chart characteristics
